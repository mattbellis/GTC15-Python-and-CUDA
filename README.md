# GTC15-Python-and-CUDA
CUDA and numba.cuda examples of the code used for the poster presented at GTC15 by Garrett Allen, Lindsay Blake, and Matt Bellis.

All Python examples can be run using the python included in Continuum IO's Anaconda
distribution, assuming that one has a CUDA-capable GPU.

For instance, if you have installed anaconda in your home directory, you would run

    ~/anaconda/bin/python device_query.py
